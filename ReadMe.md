### Elements

Elements from Datahouse AG is a customized content management system. It contains an inline editing as well as a publication process. Moreover, individual designs can be easily imported. Elements is designed in the form of a library to be embedded in a web application and to be database agnostic.


Elements mainly consists of a PHP library that can be included via composer. At least verion 7 of PHP is required. The docker image takes care of that, but you might need to manually adjust your IDE.
